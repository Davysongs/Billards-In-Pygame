# Billiards Game using Pygame

This project implements an 8 Ball Pool game using Python and the Pygame library. It simulates a virtual billiards table where players can interact with balls using a cue stick, aiming to pocket the balls strategically.

## Features

- **Ball Physics:** Realistic ball movement, collision, and interactions on the table.
- **Cue Stick Control:** Use the mouse to control the cue stick and apply force to the cue ball.
- **Pocket Detection:** Balls can be pocketed when they collide with the table's pockets.
- **Game Over Handling:** Detects game over scenarios and provides appropriate messages.

## Installation
